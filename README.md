# bitshifting-and-bitmasking

# SYNOPSIS
# based off of an imaginary machine - the Zapdragon machine and each instruction is 32 bits - the first 5 are for the opcode, 
# the next 27 are for either a memory address or an immediate operand and the last 10 are for the registers the instruction uses
# either zero one or two - each register takes up 5 bits. The project uses bit shifting and bit masking to obtain information about
# the instructions such as the opcode, the memory address/ immediate operand and the registers by storing into variables. The 
# instructions are assembly instructions such as add, sub... etc.

# MOTIVATION
# to practice bit shifting and to learn more about assembly and the machine

# TESTS
# I included some of my own tests and the expected output which can be run with the source file
